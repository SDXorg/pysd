Test Subscripts with Different Shapes
========================

There are a number of different features that make up the full functionality we know as 
'subscripts'. We'll break them all into separate tests to ease the development effort.

In this file we test situations in which different parts of the model have different shaped arrays, and use different subscript names.

This forces model tools to track subscript names for different parts of the model.
