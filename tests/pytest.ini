    ignore:Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences
    ignore:`np.bool` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To silence this warning, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.
    ignore:SelectableGroups dict interface is deprecated. Use select.:DeprecationWarning
    ignore:tostring\(\) is deprecated. Use tobytes\(\) instead.:DeprecationWarning
